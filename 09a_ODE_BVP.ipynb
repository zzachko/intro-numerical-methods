The simplest case where we are on the domain $x \\in [a,b]$ is to have conditions such that we require $u(a) = u_a$ and $u(b) = u_b$ and are commonly termed boundary value problems (BVP).  If these conditions are both at one end of the domain then we can actually phrase the ODE (PDE) again as an initial value problem (IVP).  So what do we need to do to solve these types of problems?  We will consider two approaches to this problem:\n",
